# The Plume Programming Language

This VS Code extension provides syntax highlighting for the Plume programming language. Plume is a statically typed, compiled language that is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is still in development, but you can find more information about it [here](https://github.com/plume-lang/plume).

## Features

As for now, this extension only provides syntax highlighting for Plume files. More features may be added in the future, such as code snippets and language server support.
